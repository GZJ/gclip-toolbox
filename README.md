# gclip-toolbox

copy and paste files from clipboard dropfiles. gcopy and gpaste behave the same as copying files with ctrl+c and pasting files with ctrl+v in in GUI environment (only supports windows).

# quick start
Use the `gcopy` command to copy files:

```gcopy [file1] [file2]```

Use the `gpaste` command to paste files to the current directory:

```gpaste```

You can also specify destination directories when pasting files:

```gpaste [dir1] [dir2]```
